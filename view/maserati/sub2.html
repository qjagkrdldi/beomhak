            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-delay="200">The first Maserati Ghibli was designed and unveiled at the Turin Motor show of the 1966. <br>
                It followed a tradition pioneered by Maserati with the glorious A6 1500 of 1947: it was a grand tourer.
                <br>
                That meant it delivered on the promise of glorious style, high-powered <br>
                luxury and peerless comfort over almost any distance the owner cared to consider.<br>

                A car imbued, naturally, with our motor racing DNA - a remarkably powerful force. Our <br>
                latest Ghibli model embodies the spirit that shaped both the first incarnation of 1966 and <br>
                our hunger to innovate, compete and win. That means exclusive luxury, elegant yet and <br>
                bold design and progressive technology. And, of course, empowering performance.</p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-delay="200">Uniquely, the Grand Touring is at the heart of every single Maserati. <br>
                The original concept was enticingly simple. It involved fitting a sophisticated race car <br>
                engine into a luxurious, handcrafted sedan. Seamlessly combining these two worlds <br>
                was, of course, far from simple. Yet it is exactly what Maserati did in 1947 with the A6 <br>

                1500 GT Pininfarina and some years later with the 3500GT prototype: “The White <br>
                Dame”. Such power had never been so beautifully packaged and delivered – opening up <br>
                all kinds of new, long-distance possibilities.<br></p>

            <h4 data-aos="fade-up">THE FIRST MASERATI GRANTURISMO</h4>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-delay="200">The prototype of what can be considered the first GranTurismo – i.e. the <br>
                first Maserati destined for road use and not for racing – was unveiled at the<br>
                1947 Geneva Motor Show. It was christened ‘A6’ – A in honour of Alfieri <br>
                Maserati and 6 denoting its straight-six engine. Its incredible styling was <br>

                the work of the renowned designer Pininfarina. Featuring a tapered two-<br>
                seater cabin, three horizontal ventilation inlets on the wings and futuristic <br>
                hidden headlights, the design and originality were immediately appreciated <br>
                by the public.<br></p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-delay="200">The Maserati Quattroporte is part of a story that dates back over 100 years. It’s a story of <br>
                endurance. Of embracing challenge. Of going the distance and winning. And doing it all <br>
                in audacious Italian style. <br> <br>
                In 1963, Maserati made a remarkably bold move, introducing the first ever luxury sports <br>

                sedan.<br> <br>
                It took a successful V8 motor racing engine, fitted it to a beautifully designed luxury <br>
                sedan and then proudly presented its creation to the world. <br>

                This was new. This was the fastest sedan in the world at that time.<br>
                This was the birth of the legendary Quattroporte.<br></p>
